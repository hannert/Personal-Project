I should have been keeping this in a repository when I started but OOPS! We'll start now. 
Following the Unity's Create With Code tutorials and prototypes, this will serve as my personal project and place to learn more coding/coding patterns and how everything works together.
What I plan on doing is making most of the parts of the game myself or atleast learning about it if it's too difficult. At this point I have a rudementary third person camera controller with spring arm (only for below ground) and a basic kinematic rigidbody player controller script to control the player based on the cameras movement and position in worldspace. I hope to log everything and see how far I can go with this! :)

In the past week, I've debated on whether or not to continue developing the kinematic player controller. Trying to develop your own physics engine for a predominant physics based movement system when it's already implemented is a tough task. Therefore, I will continue developing a character controller that utilizes Unity's built in physics engine and enable parts and portions of it when needed. Kinematic movement can also be toggled when needed.

Before I continue onwards with more code, I need to create diagrams and plan out more extensively before I start constructing systems programatically. To start off, creating UML Diagrams for the existing systems for later use and extensibility and readibility: The movement system is first on the list for diagramming.
